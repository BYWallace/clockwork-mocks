# ClockworkMocks

This gem provides **helpers for integration testing with clockwork**.
[Clockwork](https://github.com/Rykian/clockwork) provides a cron-like utility for ruby.
It works especially well in combination with [timecop](https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop).

## Example Usecase

Image you have a rails app with a clockwork task scheduled every night to check for inactive users and sends them reminders via email.
Your `clock.rb` file would look as follows:

```ruby
module Clockwork
  every(1.day, 'inactives', at: '00:00') do
    User.inactive.each do
      Mailer.reminder_mail.deliver_later
    end
  end
end
```

By using ClockworkMocks in combination with RSpec and Timecop, you could test this as follows:

```ruby
RSpec.describe ... do
  before { ClockworkMocks.reset_rspec(method(:allow), method(:receive)) }
  let!(:user) { create(:user) }

  context 'after 7 days without action' do
    before do
      Timecop.freeze 7.days.from_now
      ClockworkMocks.work
    end
    after { Timecop.return }

    it 'should have sent the user a reminder' do
      expect(ActionMailer::Base.deliveries).not_to be_empty
    end
  end
end
```

Note that this does not replace proper unit tests, but gives you the possibility to additionally test your system as a whole.

## Installation

Add this to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'clockwork-mocks'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install clockwork-mocks

## Usage

### Initialization with RSpec

```ruby
RSpec.describe ... do
  before { ClockworkMocks.reset_rspec(method(:allow), method(:receive), 'path/to/clock.rb') }
end
```

If you do not pass a clock file path to `ClockworkMocks.init_rspec` and you are in a rails environment it will assume `"#{Rails.root}/clock.rb"` by default.

### General Initialization

```ruby
ClockworkMocks.scheduler.handler do |job, time|
  # something
end

ClockworkMocks.scheduler.every(1.day, 'some task', at: '23:00') do
  # something
end
```

Using this interface, you can use any stub provider to stub `Clockwork`'s methods and call `ClockworkMocks.scheduler`'s methods instead.
For example with rspec-mock:

```ruby
allow(Clockwork).to receive(:handler) do |&block|
  ClockworkMocks.scheduler.handler(&block)
end

allow(Clockwork).to receive(:every) do |interval, name, hash, &block|
  ClockworkMocks.scheduler.every interval, name, hash, &block
end

load 'path/to/clock.rb'
```

### Executing clockwork tasks

At any time you can call `ClockworkMocks.work` to execute all tasks that are due.
This works especially well in combination with timecop (although the latter is not a requirement):

```ruby
Timecop.freeze(2.days.from_now) do
  ClockworkMocks.work
end
```

Tasks will be executed in correct order.
If enough time passed, tasks will be executed multiple times:

```ruby
ClockworkMocks.scheduler.every(1.second, 'often') { puts 'often' }
ClockworkMocks.scheduler.every(2.seconds, 'not-so-often') { puts 'not so often' }

Timecop.freeze(3.seconds.from_now) do
  ClockworkMocks.work
end
```

outputs

```
often
often
not so often
often
```

**Note:**
Tasks will always be executed in time zone UTC.
This prevents weird corner cases during switches of daylight savings time.

### Sidekiq

If you use clockwork to schedule sidekiq jobs but want them to actually execute during integration testing I recommend one of two options:

1. Use sidekiq's inline mode to execute all jobs immediately during integration testing.
   This works well if you don't on scheduled jobs or don't care about the execution date.
2. Use a library like [sidekiq-fake-scheduler](https://github.com/dpoetzsch/sidekiq-fake-scheduler).
   This is superior to inline mode in that it respects the dates when the jobs are scheduled so you can test your application more fine-grained.
   The proposed gem neatly integrates with clockwork-mocks.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
